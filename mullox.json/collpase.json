His father Prasanta was devastated when told his son had an incurable and inoperable a Diffuse Instrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). A second neurosurgeon confirmed the diagnosis.</br></br>Resection is not offered for DIPGs because of the location in a critical part of the brain, the pons, and by the time a diagnosis is made the tumour has infiltrated normal cells.</br></br>Desperate for a miracle, the Barmans found the celebrated Australian neurosurgeon Charlie Teo suggested the little boy have urgent surgery and that with the tumour removed Mikolaj “should hopefully have a long and happy life.”</br></br>The surgery was performed in Singapore on October 11, 2018. Apart from the intial $80,000 for the operation, the Barmans had to pay $40,000 to hire an air ambulance to fly Mijolaj back to India where he languished in intensive care for months. Mikolaj’s care cost nearly $250,000 and the rest of his short life was spent in a room staring at a ceiling. He never walked, talked or breathed on his own again. His only means of communication was blinking his eyes.</br></br>Ten months after the catastrophic operation, the aggressive tumour returned and Mikolaj died. In response to this news, Dr Teo emailed saying, “I'm so sorry, but you have given him every possible chance to live longer and I would like to reassure you that he has had the most aggressive treatment possible,”.","side":"right","color":"#8F9EC2","highlight":true,"details":[{"details":[{"Age":"4, from Assam, India."}]}],"image":"https://www.smh.com.au/interactive/hub/media/collapsible-profile/10908/Mikolaj.png"}}
